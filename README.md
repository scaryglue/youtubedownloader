# YouTube Downloader Script
This is a *small* and *lightweight* script that downloads YouTube videos in your specified format.

Still has some work to do. For example it needs to be more user-friendly, the selection of formats is very confusing.
The script is based on pytube, which means you need two things before using this script:

1. Python 3. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. pytube. Install it by running 'pip install pytube'. Pytube sometimes gives back a 404 error, then you need to download the newest version of pytube, assuming they have already fixed it. You can specify the pytube version by typing 'pip install pytube==10.8.5' (10.8.5 is currently the newest version)
